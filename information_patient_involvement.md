title: Patient Involvement
---

At SwissPedHealth, we believe that the best health outcomes are achieved when patients are active participants in their own care. Therefore, we actively involve patients in the design and application of our research projects. This ensures that their opinions are included, and that we better understand their needs and experiences.

## Why Patient Involvement?

Patient involvement enriches our research in several ways. Firstly, it provides us with unique perspectives on the practical aspects of living with diseases. This is invaluable in designing interventions that are both effective and acceptable to the patients. Secondly, patient involvement promotes transparency and trust in the research process, which encourages greater patient cooperation and satisfaction.

## How Do We Involve Patients?

We involve patients at various stages of our research projects. This may include seeking their input during the project design stage, involving them in the implementation of the project, or inviting them to contribute to the interpretation and dissemination of the research findings. We believe that patients can provide insights that may not be evident to medical professionals, leading to more comprehensive and patient-centered outcomes.

## Do I have to contribute?

We encourage patient and family involvement, but we do not expect all patients or their families to contribute.
Dedicated patient representatives generously contribute their attention to meet with doctors, scientists, and management to ensure that patient involvement is continuously considered to help us build key resources.

## Ensuring Openness and Fairness

Openness and fairness are key elements of our approach to patient involvement. We strive to ensure that all patients feel their voices are heard and their experiences are valued. We also take steps to ensure that involvement opportunities are accessible to all patients, regardless of their circumstances.

## Conclusion

At SwissPedHealth, patient involvement is not just a token gesture - it is a fundamental part of how we work. We believe that by involving patients in our research, we can better understand their needs and experiences, leading to the development of more effective and personalized treatments in our community.
