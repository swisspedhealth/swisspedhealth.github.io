<!-- ## Background -->

<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Life-threatening Phenotypes</h3>
Rare diseases are a group of over 7,000 disorders that have a strong impact on health and have major social and economic consequences.
They affect 400 million people worldwide, including about 500,000 in Switzerland.
Rare diseases often affect children, causing premature death or chronic disability.
They are found at increased rates in critically ill neonates or children admitted to ICUs.
Rare diseases can cause life-threatening conditions such as metabolic dysfunction, encephalopathy, severe infection, or cardiac failure.
Extreme phenotypes (severe forms of rare diseases) are interesting targets for finding rare, causal genetic and biochemical variants because patients are more likely to carry harmful low-frequency or de novo alleles.
The identification of causal genetic and biochemical variants in rare, severe diseases can be extremely valuable for patients, particularly children. 
By gaining a better understanding of these diseases, healthcare professionals may be able to develop more effective treatments and provide better care for affected individuals.
</div>

<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
<h3> Promise of Multi-omics for Personalized Medicine</h3>
In the past decade, the discovery rate of the causes of rare diseases has been increasing due to the ability to generate and analyze genomic data at reasonable cost.
A pioneering project in Australia used rapid DNA sequencing (WES) and resulted in a genetic diagnosis in 51% of children, leading to a change in management in 76% of patients.
Adding transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) increases the diagnostic yield of WES or WGS.
Multi-omics technologies simultaneously assess the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, which provides a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships.
Integration of multi-omics data has the potential to identify rare genomic variants and their functional validation, leading to a higher diagnostic yield compared to WGS alone.
Multi-omics has the potential to be a breakthrough diagnostic approach in children with extreme phenotypes by enabling the prompt initiation of lifesaving treatments and/or a change in management.
</div>
</div>

<hr />

<h2 id="gaps-in-current-practice">Gaps in current practice</h2>

<p>WES and WGS are used in diagnostics, but patient selection is biased and there are still a high proportion of patients with undiagnosed diseases. 
The identification of large numbers of Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) in DNA sequencing datasets makes the picture more complicated.
There is a need for a multi-omics workflow to provide better diagnostic yield compared to WGS.</p>

<p>Current gaps in knowledge and practice include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delayed diagnosis of rare diseases.
There is often a delay in diagnosing rare diseases and inconsistencies in investigating and treating them.</li>
  <li>Lack of novel approaches to rare disease diagnosis.
Conventional methodologies (WES and biochemical testing) are used, but they can be time consuming and have low diagnostic yield.</li>
  <li>Unavailability of clinical multi-omics.
Multi-omics technologies are currently limited to research settings.</li>
  <li>Clinical diagnostic workflows not adapted for multi-omics.
Clinical diagnostic workflows are not designed for discovering novel diseases.</li>
  <li>Lack of information from end-users on multi-omics.
Information on how providers and families respond to multi-omics results is currently unknown.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="project-phases">Project phases</h2>

<p><span style="color: green; font-size: 150%;">☑</span>
<strong>Phase 1 Complete:</strong>
Multi-omics approach was used to diagnose and characterize 210 individuals affected with the rare inborn error of metabolism methylmalonic aciduria.
The combination of genomic, transcriptomic, proteotyping, and metabolomic information with phenotypic dataset led to the identification of a molecular diagnosis for 84% of the patients.
The multi-omics technology was found to be powerful for diagnosis and discovery of pathomechanistic factors in rare diseases.
A workflow for data acquisition, transfer, storage, and analysis within the PHRT/SPHN infrastructure was established.
Another genomic and transcriptomic workflow was established to identify 2 novel diseases in 89 patients with extreme immunological phenotypes.
This resulted in identifying rare diseases in children with life-threatening extreme phenotypes through combining clinical evaluation and multi-omics exploration.</p>

<p><span style="color: green; font-size: 150%;">☐</span>
<strong>Phase 2 Ongoing:</strong>
The integrated approach of WGS, RNA-seq, proteotyping, and metabolomics will be applied to existing cohorts of extreme phenotypes to identify rare deleterious genetic variants.
Novel computational methods will be developed to integrate multi-omics data into a diagnostic workflow.</p>

<p><span style="color: green; font-size: 150%;">☐</span>
<strong>Phase 3 Ongoing:</strong>
The workflow developed in Phase 2 will be tested in a prospective cohort of 140 children with extreme phenotypes.
Provider and family uptake of multi-omics information will be examined.
The aim is to identify rare diseases causing extreme phenotypes even in single patients.</p>
